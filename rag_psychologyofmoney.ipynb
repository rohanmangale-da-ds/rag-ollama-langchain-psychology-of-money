       "'The money industry—investing, personal ﬁnance, business planning—is another story.\\nFinance has scooped up the smartest minds coming from top universities over the last twodecades. Financial Engineering was the most popular major in Princeton’s School ofEngineering a decade ago. Is there any evidence it has made us better investors?\\nI have seen none.\\nThrough collective trial and error over the years we learned how to become better farmers,skilled plumbers, and advanced chemists. But has trial and error taught us to becomebetter with our personal ﬁnances? Are we less likely to bury ourselves in debt? More likelyto save for a rainy day? Prepare for retirement? Have realistic views about what moneydoes, and doesn’t do, to our happiness?\\nI’ve seen no compelling evidence.\\nMost of the reason why, I believe, is that we think about and are taught about money inways that are too much like physics (with rules and laws) and not enough like psychology(with emotions and nuance).\\nAnd that, to me, is as fascinating as it is important.'"

Everyone thinks about it alittle diﬀerently. It oﬀers lessons on things that apply to many areas of life, like risk,conﬁdence, and happiness. Few topics oﬀer a more powerful magnifying glass that helpsexplain why people behave the way they do than money. It is one of the greatest shows onEarth.\\nMy own appreciation for the psychology of money is shaped by more than a decade ofwriting on the topic. I began writing about ﬁnance in early 2008. It was the dawn of aﬁnancial crisis and the worst recession in 80 years.\\nTo write about what was happening, I wanted to ﬁgure out what was happening. But theﬁrst thing I learned after the ﬁnancial crisis was that no one could accurately explain whathappened, or why it happened, let alone what should be done about it. For every goodexplanation there was an equally convincing rebuttal.'"
